# 写作

## 原则

- 重要的事情先说
- 分解(比如你要写大象，就可以按大象的种类，年龄进行分类，然后对每一类的进行单独描写)
- 链接词(转折however，but，yet nonetheless，承接 moreover，furthermore，举例，for example，for instance，总结 in conclusion)
- 小模板 (比较关系(a比b好，或两者相差不大)，时间顺序，因果关系(因为前者发生，导致后者))

## 模仿

- 懂了原则还要看他人如何运用(母语者或者是英文写作水平高的人如何运用
- 光有原则不行，不能按照自己的理解来运用原则
- 光模仿不行，需要知道别人运用了什么原则，为什么写得好

模仿与原则的关系
模仿是练习，需要将原则转化为自己的本能这样才能提升自己的写作能力。
练习方法：全文背诵，翻译，写作反馈再写作业(加群)

## 反馈

- 写作能力的提高的前提是鉴赏能力的提高，只有知道什么是好的文章，才能朝着那个方向努力
- 提升鉴赏能力和写作能力非常好的办法是有一个写作水平高出你很多的人告诉你，你写的东西哪里不好，为什么。
- 反馈见效——1个月 有兴趣，有写作感觉

# 听力

- 做题

1. 听前：预读题目勾选关键词–预测读音 预测意思 不听问题
2. 听中：勾画听到的东西–对应程度高的为正确选项的几率大

- 练习

  听一句写一句，写出来为止

# 写作能力的重要性

## Directions：

 For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay on **the importance of writing ability and how to develop it**. you should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.

## 范文：

 Tsinghua University’s decision to make Writing and Communication a required course has sparked a heated debate recently.

 Many people regard writing as a must-have skill only for certain professions, on which they don’t have to put much emphasis. But writing, as I see it, is a basic ability everyone can’t do without. From composing a well-organized paper, to giving a sharply-focused work report, and even posting a sentiment on WeChat Moments, all aspects of life just require this ability. On top of communications, writing sharpens out logic and cognitive thinking, for it requires reflection, analysis and artful presentation of information and views. So it’s no surprise that top-ranking universities like Harvard made writing a compulsory course even for science majors.

 Then how to improve writing skills? Certainly there is a shortcut to learning layout and word choice. For example, you can read and imitate excellent works, learning skills from them like expression, rhetoric and coherence. But tricks aren’t enough. Since language is mind-based, one can hardly become a good writer without reading extensively and thinking deeply. Hone your thinking skills while reading, and your writing can be really improved.

## 写作储备：

- Be it a school, college, workplace or a society, writing has become a vital yardstick to assess one’s knowledge and intellectuality.

  不管是在中小学，大学，职场还是在社会上，写作已经成为评估一个人知识和智力的重要标尺。

- Writing improves the thinking process and contributes to the development of critical thinking skills because an individual has to clearly state ideas and lay out arguments in such a way as to cultivate higher order thinking.

  写作能够改善思维过程，并有助于培养批判性思维能力，因为（写作中）个人需要清楚地表述观点并展开论证，这种方法能使我们培养起高阶推理思维。

- Taking the time to polish your writing skills is likely to pay off in the longer term, and learning how to write specific types of documents will also be useful. For example, being able to prepare a strong summary is a skill that is extremely useful for briefing senior managers.

  花时间完善你的写作技巧从长远来看可能很有价值，学习写作一些特定类型的公文也很有用。举个例子，在给主管作简报时，搞定一份有说服力的概要就是个相当有用的技巧。

- The ability to write the better sentence or choose the better word does not come from a book, the way grammar can come from a book. It comes with experience. With grammar, you can study the rules, memorize them, and then apply them to your writing almost immediately. The subtler aspects of writing can be learned, but they are usually learned over time through a combination of reading, studying the craft of writing, and practicing.

  写出更好的句子或恰当选择字词的能力并不像语法那样来自书本，而是来源于经验。对于语法，你可以学习规则、记住规则，并且可以几乎马上就将其运用到写作中去。但你要学到写作中一些更微妙的东西，往往需要通过一段时间的阅读，学打写作草稿、练笔实践相结合的方式才行。

- Make your advice more practical by demonstrating your tips with lively examples.

  通过生动的例子来论述你的建议，是指更加切实可行。
